# ATF-AI Architecture

The **ATF-AI** system provides an interoperable compliance layer for digitalized financial assets.
It validates asset descriptors through verifiable attestations, linked ledgers, and auditable provenance.

**Core Components**
- `specs/eip-8040-atf.schema.json` — Schema definition.
- `api/openapi.yaml` — Verify endpoint specification.
- `specs/registry.json` — Sample asset registry.
- `docs/manifesto.md` — Governance principles.

**Governance**
The protocol is AI-governed under AgroNet Labs, coordinated by Copilot and Codex GPT automation.
